# Quantitative Finance Modeling and Real-Time Streaming

Welcome to the **Quantitative Finance Modeling and Real-Time Streaming** project! This repository contains a collection of scripts, notebooks, and models designed for quantitative finance applications, including portfolio optimization, option pricing, bond pricing, backtesting, and real-time data streaming using Trader Workstation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Below is an overview of the main files and their purpose:

### **Models**
- **`BlackScholesMonteCarlo.py`**: Implements a Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing using the Black-Scholes model.
- **`BondPricingVasicek.py`**: Calculates bond prices based on the Vasicek interest rate model.
- **`MarkowitzModel.py`**: Python implementation of the Markowitz portfolio optimization model.
- **`OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess.py`**: Models mean-reverting processes, useful in financial time series modeling.
- **`VaRMonteCarlo.py`**: Simulates Value-at-Risk (VaR) using the Monte Carlo approach.
- **`VasicekModel.py`**: Implements the Vasicek model for interest rate modeling.

### **Notebooks**
- **`DeepLearningModel.ipynb`**: Demonstrates the development of a deep learning model for financial data.
- **`Iterative Backtesting.ipynb`**: Analyzes and backtests iterative trading strategies.
- **`Machine Learning - Regression Strategy.ipynb`**: Uses regression techniques to develop and test a trading strategy.
- **`MarkowitzModel.ipynb`**: Notebook version of the Markowitz portfolio optimization process, including visualization.
- **`Mean Reversion.ipynb`**: Explores and backtests mean-reversion trading strategies.
- **`Thesis - Loading Data, Basic Statistics and Simple Moving Average.ipynb`**: Introduces basic statistical analysis and simple moving average strategies.
- **`Thesis - Real Time Streaming.ipynb`**: Streams live market data from Trader Workstation for real-time analysis.

### **Personal Projects**
- **`DNNModel.py`**: Constructs and trains a deep neural network for financial prediction.
- **`Thesis Files`**: Real-time data streaming and analysis based on live data from Trader Workstation.
